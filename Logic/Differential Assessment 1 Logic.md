I want to add another questionnaire to this app. It should be called ‚ÄúDifferential Assessment 1‚Äù and should be the same as the primary questionnaire but with different questions, answers, videos, photos, scoring, and resutls logic. Below I‚Äôve listed the information you need to translate the google sheets logic (where the questionnaire was originally built) into a questionnaire within this app. Please translate this logic the same way that you have for the primary questionnaire. Before you generate the code and tell me how to implement it, is there any other information you need to know from me to complete this task?


- Here is the information about the google sheet references in the logic:

The injury score mapping is the same as for the primary questionnaire (A=‚Äúpulley injury grade I-II‚Äù, B=‚Äúpulley injury grade III-IV‚Äù, etc.).
B3:B7 are the injury IDs (A, B, C, D, etc.).
C3:C7 are the names of the injuries (cyst, lumbrical injury, pulley injury grade I-II, etc.).
D3:D7 are the scores for each injury. C12 is the cell that shows the displayed result.
C15 is the cell that shows the results summary.
D17 is the cell that shows teh nerve issue possibility result.
D18 is the cell that shows the cyst indication result.
C20 is the cell that shows the additional information.
[MainScoring]'!C48 is the nerve issue combined score from the primary assessment and differential assessment 1.
Differential!D99=TRUE means they answered ‚Äúno‚Äù to ‚ÄúDo any of the nerve tension tests create symptoms at or very near to your injury site?‚Äù on differential assessment 1 and Differential!C99=TRUE means they answered ‚Äúyes.‚Äù
Differential!C111=TRUE means they answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to ‚ÄúDo any of the nerve tension tests create more intense symptoms anywhere in your injured arm compared to your uninjured arm (not including the neck and upper traps)?‚Äù on differential assessment 1 and Differential!D111=TRUE means they answered ‚Äúno.‚Äù
Primary!C96=TRUE means they answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to ‚ÄúCan you feel an abnormal mass/lump at (or very near to) the area of discomfort/pain?‚Äù on the primary questionnaire.
Differential!C57=TRUE means they answeres ‚Äúyes‚Äù to ‚ÄúHave you recovered from another injury to the same finger within the last six months that caused discomfort/pain in the same area?‚Äù on differential assessment 1.
[MainScoring]'!C49 is the cyst combined score from the primary assessment and differential assessment 1.
Primary!C14=TRUE means they answered ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat type of injury did you sustain?‚Äù on the primary questionnaire.
Primary!C96=FALSE means they did not choose ‚Äúyes‚Äù to ‚ÄúCan you feel an abnormal mass/lump at (or very near to) the area of discomfort/pain?‚Äù on the primary questionnaire.
Differential!C57=FALSE means they did not choose ‚Äúyes‚Äù to ‚ÄúHave you recovered from another injury to the same finger within the last six months that caused discomfort/pain in the same area?‚Äù on differential assessment 1.
Primary!C14=FALSE means they did not answer ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat type of injury did you sustain?‚Äù on the primary questionnaire.
