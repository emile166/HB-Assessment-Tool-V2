I‚Äôm creating a new questionnaire called Pulley Injury Severity Assessment. I‚Äôve already created the file (PulleySeverityQuestionnaire.jsx) and copied and pasted all the code from the PrimaryQuestionnaire.jsx file. I‚Äôve changed the name of the function from PrimaryQuestionnaire to PulleySeverityQuestionnaire. This new questionnaire should operate very similarly to the other questionnaires, but as usual the results logic needs to be unique and the injury mapping is different (see injuryMapping.js file for reference).

I need you to translate the results logic I originally wrote for a google sheet (written below) into logic that works in this assessment app and that is consistent with the way the logic is written for the other questionnaires. I‚Äôve put a comment on line 158 to show you where I think the logic should go.

One thing that is different about the results logic for this questionnaire compared to the other ones is that this one requires an additional ‚Äúdisplayed results‚Äù component for the location of the injury (which should be displayed below the regular displayedResults section on the results page under the heading ‚ÄúYour responses suggestion this location:‚Äù). Basically, the displayed results for this questionnaire are broken into two parts: the grade of the injury and the location of the injury. The grade and locations are containd in the injury mapping, where A-E are grades and F-K are locations.

Make sure you use question IDs and answer IDs rather than indices in the logic whenever possible to ensure the code is flexible.

Before you generate the code and tell me how to implement it, is there any other information you need to know from me to complete this task?

Here is some additional logic (written in plain English) that is not a part of the google sheet:

checkForEarlyCompletion conditions:

1. After answering the first three questions of this questionnaire (injuryType, obviousSound, and visibleBowstringing), check the answers. If the user has selected injuryTypeAnswer1, obviousSoundAnswer1, and visibleBowstringingAnswer1, the user should be taken to the results page and the displayedResult should be Grade IVb.

2. Before the user is shown the tissueLoadingDrag question, check to see if Grade III, Grade IVa, or Grade IVb is the top scoring grade result. If one of them is, and it has two or more points than the other grades, then the user should be taken to the results page.

3. Before the user is shown the injuredPulley question, check to see if the current top-scoring location has two or more points than the rest of the locations. If so, the user should be taken to the results page.
