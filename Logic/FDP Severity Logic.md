I‚Äôve added a new severity questionnaire called FDPSeverityQuestionnaire.jsx. I‚Äôve copied and pasted all the code from the PulleySeverityQuestionnaire.jsx file into this new FDPSeverityQuestionnaire.jsx file. I‚Äôve changed the name of the function from PulleySeverityQuestionnaire to FDPSeverityQuestionnaire. This new questionnaire should operate very similarly to the other questionnaires, but as usual the results logic needs to be unique. I‚Äôve added the appropriate injury mapping to the injuryMapping.js file under the heading ‚ÄòFDP Injury Severity Assessment‚Äô, where A=Grade I, B=Grade II, and C=Grade III.

I need you to translate the results logic I originally wrote for a google sheet (written below) into logic that works in this assessment app and that is consistent with the way the logic is written for the other questionnaires. I‚Äôve put a comment on line 152 to show you where I think the logic should go.

Rather than having a locationResult variable like the Pulley Severity Questionnaire, this questionnaire has a versionResult variable which will need to be added and handled in the results display.

Make sure you use question IDs and answer IDs rather than indices in the logic whenever possible to ensure the code is flexible.

Before you generate the code and tell me how to implement it, is there any other information you need to know from me to complete this task?

Here is a key so you know what the google sheet logic is referencing:
D3=first grade score
B3=first grade key
D4=second grade score
B4=second grade key
D5=third grade score
B5=third grade key
C3=first grade name
C4=second grade name
C5=third grade name
C10=displayedResult
C13=versionResult
C16=resultsSummary
Severity!C269=injuryMechanismAnswer1
Severity!D269=injuryMechanismAnswer2
Severity!C279=fifthDigitAnswer1
Severity!D279=fifthDigitAnswer2
