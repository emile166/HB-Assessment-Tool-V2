Iâ€™ve added a new severity questionnaire called NerveIssueIdentificationQuestionnaire.jsx. Iâ€™ve copied and pasted all the code from the JointCapsulitisSeverityQuestionnaire.jsx file into this new NerveIssueIdentificationQuestionnaire.jsx file. Iâ€™ve changed the name of the function from JointCapsulitisSeverityQuestionnaire to NerveIssueIdentificationQuestionnaire. Iâ€™ve added the questionnaire data to the nerveIssueIdentificationData.js file in the questionnaireData folder. This new questionnaire should operate similarly to the rest of the questionnaires, but the results logic is a bit different. There is no scoring; instead, the results are calculated directly based on the answers the user selects. Therefore, there is no injury mapping in the injuryMapping.js file needed for this questionnaire.

I need you to translate the results logic I originally wrote for a google sheet (written below) into logic that works in this assessment app and that is consistent with the way the logic is written for the other questionnaires. Iâ€™ve put a comment on line 152 to show you where I think the logic should go, including handleSubmit.

Make sure you use question IDs and answer IDs rather than indices in the logic whenever possible to ensure the code is flexible.

Before you generate the code and tell me how to implement it, is there any other information you need to know from me to complete this task?

Here is a key so you know what the google sheet logic is referencing:
C4=displayedResult
C7=resultsSummary
Severity!C601=nerveTensionTestOneAnswer1
Severity!D601=nerveTensionTestOneAnswer2
Severity!E601=nerveTensionTestOneAnswer3
Severity!C613=nerveTensionTestTwoAnswer1
Severity!D613=nerveTensionTestTwoAnswer2
Severity!C625=nerveTensionTestThreeAnswer1
Severity!D625=nerveTensionTestThreeAnswer2
Severity!E625=nerveTensionTestThreeAnswer3
